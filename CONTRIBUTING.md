Since Diário Oficial seeks to become a trustful source of official governmental announcements, every data source must also be trustful. A private company publishing government gazettes without official permission, for instance, is not a trustful source.

At this moment, the project aims for the 100 top Brazilian municipalities by population. If you want to help us reach this goal, [an ordered list can be found on Wikipedia](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_de_munic%C3%ADpios_do_Brasil_por_popula%C3%A7%C3%A3o).

## Automated Testing

The project is backed by a test suite, which can be run with a single command.

```console
$ make test
```
